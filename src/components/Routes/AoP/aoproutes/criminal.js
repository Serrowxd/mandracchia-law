        to be evaluated and decisions need to be made. A Montgomery County
        criminal defense lawyer from Mandracchia Law LLC can help you understand
        your legal options and explain the possible outcomes. We take a team
        approach to collecting and analyzing evidence, and develop a plan using

        Sometimes we must go to trial. When we do, you can be assured of an
        aggressive defense strategy. Other times, we are able to negotiate a
        plea bargain to eliminate your risk of an adverse trial verdict. We take
        the time to explain your options and help you choose the most beneficial
        option for your particular circumstances.
